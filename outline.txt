Roadblocks
  Query only necessary information on reviews page
    Removing reviews from initial query decreases latency by 1.0s on average however,
    in order to query graphQL separately, the restaurant ID of the clicked restaurant
    needs to be passed from the client to the server in order to make queries for reviews
    of that specific restaurant. No clear method has been identified to successfully decouple
    the restaurant ID from the client and dynmically send it to the server. Current solution
    works with query that requests all data on intial page render, but comes at a performance 
    cost of about 1.0s of loading on intial render.
  Solution
    - Configure graphQL endpoint to do a post request from client with ID of restaurant on req.body
    and congure new post request to Yelp API endpiont within graphql Route
    - Switch from graphQL to express for routes and handle logic to post to Yelp GraphQL endpoint after 
    the id is received on server from client. Send final queried data back as response to client.
