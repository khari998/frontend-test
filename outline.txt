Roadblocks
  Query only necessary information on reviews page
    Removing reviews from initial query decreases latency by 1.0s on average however,
    in order to query graphQL separately, the restaurant ID of the clicked restaurant
    needs to be passed from the client to the server in order to make queries for reviews
    of that specific restaurant. No clear method has been identified to successfully decouple
    the restaurant ID from the client and dynmically send it to the server. Current solution
    works with query that requests all data on intial page render, but comes at a performance 
    cost of about 1.0s of loading on intial render.

  Refactor server code to typescript
  Persist data to backend (favorite restaurants)
